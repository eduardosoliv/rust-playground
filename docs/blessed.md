An unofficial guide to the Rust ecosystem

The standard library in Rust is not "batteries included", excluding functionality like HTTP(S), JSON, timezones, random numbers, and async IO. The recommended crate directory is a hand-curated guide to the crates.io ecosystem, helping you choose which crates to use.

See also: [crates.io](https://crates.io/) (the official crates directory) and [lib.rs](https://lib.rs/) (a semi-curated directory).
